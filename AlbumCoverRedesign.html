							<h2>Album Cover Redesign</h2>
							<p>I wanted to try my hand at redesigning an album from my favorite band at the time, Imagine Dragons. With this project, I wanted to put some restrictions on myself to see what i could do.
								<br> 1. The new design should keep the original in mind.
								<br> 2. Any stock photos I use, had to be taken by me.
								<br> 3. I only had a few days to complete it.
								<br> <br>
								Due to the short time limit I knew that I did not have much time to take photos, So i dived into my photography collection.
								After finding six photos that I liked to work with, I hopped into photoshop and started messing around with them.
								Over several iterations of doing this, I came upon a layout that I was happy with and started making a mockup of my new design to see how it might look as a product.</p>
